**Last Updated:** February 22, 2018

Tethys Extensions provide a way for app developers to extend Tethys Platform and modularize functionality that is used accross multiple apps. For example, models, templates and static resources that are used by multiple apps could be created in a Tethys Extension and imported/referenced in the apps that use that functionality. Developers can also create custom gizmos using Tethys Extensions. This section will provide an overview of how to develop Tethys Extensions and use them in apps.
